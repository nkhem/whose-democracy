Similar to how LinkedIn serves as a platform for keeping up with your professional network, Whose Democracy is a platform for keeping up with your civic network by allowing users to easily draft and send emails to Senate and House members, view friends' emails to representatives for inspiration and to better understand the issues that matter to their friends, and to make it easy and social to stay civically engaged.

It will use SmartyStreets Geocoding API to look up users' representatives and Phantom of the Capitol API to fill out the contact forms of members of the US Congress in order to make emailing representatives easy and user-friendly.
